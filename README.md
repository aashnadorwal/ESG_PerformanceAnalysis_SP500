# ESG Performance & Risk Analysis in the S&P 500

This project explores the ESG score performance of S&P 500 companies. I’m interested in analyzing how companies’ ESG scores relate to their financial performance, such as stock returns and revenue growth. By examining ESG data alongside financial metrics, the project aims to understand whether companies with higher sustainability scores tend to perform better financially. The goal is to provide investors and stakeholders with insights into how strong ESG performance might be connected to better business outcomes.
